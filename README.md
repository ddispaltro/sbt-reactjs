This plugin hooks your JSX files in to the Asset compilation phase.
It uses the autoPlugin feature with `0.13.5` to make the setup dead-simple.

To use this plugin use the addSbtPlugin command within your project's
plugins.sbt (or as a global setting) i.e.:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.ddispaltro" % "sbt-reactjs" % "0.5.0")
```

Your project's build file also needs to enable sbt-web plugins. For example with build.sbt:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(SbtWeb)
```

## Options

 - `harmony`: Turns on JS transformations such as ES6 Classes etc.
 - `stripTypes`: Strips out type annotations.
 - `sourceMapInline`: Embed inline sourcemap in transformed source

The artifact is hosted as part of the [community plugins](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.5/docs/Community/Bintray-For-Plugins.html)
via [bintray service](https://bintray.com/ddispaltro/sbt-plugins/sbt-reactjs/view).
